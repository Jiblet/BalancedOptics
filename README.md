# BalancedOptics
Hi; I'm Fershte; and I made a gigantic balance patch.
EFT's balance is extremely ill fiting for a single player experience.
This specific mod is designed so that the choice between any given optic or mount of the same class is merely cosmeticly different.

Logic:
No micro red dot should have ANY ergo penalty, and neither should their mounts.
Holos should be -1, to match the Trijicon SRS. Cobra meme removed.
Assault Scopes should match the bis, the HAMR, at -2 ergo.

Actual scopes should be standardized as -3 for 1 to 6, -4 for big scopes, and -5 for specialty scopes.



This is part of a mod family - It also includes "BalancedForegrips" which rebalances them so that the Fortis Shift isn't the only grip worth using.

And I'm Jiblet. I updated Freshte excellent work to include the scopes introduced in 12.12
I also gave the Mosin PU 3.5 scope and it's mount a bit of a tickle. You're welcome.
